# My-Library

# Description

A repository for storing some code typed by me in Data Structure and Algorithm course.

# Project structure

## Header files

All header files are stored in __include__ directory.

## Implements

All implements are stored in __src__ directory.

# Concept

- List, linked list, array, queue, stack.
- Sort algorithms.

## List interface

An interface that describes some basic feature for a data structure collection of variables with the same data type.

Basic features:

1. __construct__ methods:
    - Constructor (just an interface, has no any influences to derived structures).
    - Get a copy of list.

2. __get__ methods:

    - Get the size of list.
    - Get the information that whether a list is empty.

3. __find__ methods:

    - Find an element by index.
    - Find an element by value.

4. Modification methods:

    - Insert an element in a specific position.
    - Remove an element at a specific position.
    - Split a list into two sublists.
    - Merge two lists into an list.
    - Reverse an list.
    - Clear all elements of an list.
